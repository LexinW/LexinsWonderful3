First Javascript project! 

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page


I wrote comments throughout the entire javascript file for a breakdown of all the code.

I really enjoyed starting Javascript. This was challenging, but I was able to figure everything out thanks to mozilla docs (hehe) and google!

I can not figure out how to take a screen shot on my new laptop, so just trust me I tested the site multiple times and everything seems to work.
